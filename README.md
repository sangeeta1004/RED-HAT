## About ATM
ATMs are automated cash dispensing booths connected to the banks through their network. Using the ATM, you can withdraw cash (if you have account and cash in the bank), deposit money in any desired account, pay bills, change the PIN, and many more uses. The ATMs are periodically refilled with different cash denominations in the cash slot. The ATM allows cash dispensing only to the bank account holders with credit or debit card of the bank. The banks provide ATM cards to the account holders, and each card has a *unique number*  with a magnetic strip that ATMs read to process the transaction.

> **Note:** The ATM might ask you to select an account in case you hold multiple accounts with the bank.
