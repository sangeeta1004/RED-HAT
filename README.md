# RED-HAT
This is a RED HAT assessment strech task to assess the ability of the tehcnical writer to handle the GitHub repository. 
The project task is to create a Github page that displays the procedure on How to withdraw money from the ATM. 
This procedure is tried and tested several times and never fails due to its simple language. It might not be the perfect approach, but for the beginner's it is easy to follow.
The best part about this that you do not need a license. Happy reading!
